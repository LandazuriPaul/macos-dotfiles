# VS Code installation

## Settings and extensions

Once VS Code is installed, first install the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension.

You'll then be able to connect to your GitHub account and pick the correct gist to where your settings are saved in.

## Fonts

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
